INTRODUCTION
============
This directory contains the source code to build the ABCE generic services. Which exposes the ABCE as a set of web-services.


HOW TO BUILD THE ABCE GENERIC SERVICES
=======================

Make sure you have built the core-abce. You can do this by running the following command from the core-abce folder:
    
    mvn clean install -DskipTests

Run the command:

  ./compileServices.sh

This will create 10 war files in the target directory, two for each of the issuance, user, verification, inspection, and revocation services. The war files begining with "selfcontained-" includes a Jetty servers, which you can run them directly from the command line. See below. The ones without the "selfcontained-" prefix are for deployment in an application server, e.g. Tomcat.



HOW TO USE THE ABCE GENERIC SERVICES
=======================

This section will present a small tuturial which will show you the most commonly used parts of the interface provided by the ABCE generic services. The tutorial expect you to be familiar with privacy-abc technology and the architecture of the ABCE (as described in H2.2 - ABC4Trust Architecture for Developers, see https://abc4trust.eu/index.php/pub).

The tutorial is based on a scenario with an issuer of tickets (the issuer), a user, and a verifier (e.g. a theater or a sporting venue)

The tutorial currently consists of the following steps:

 1) Setup system parameters
 2) Setup issuance parameters
 3) Issue ticket (credential)
 4) Present ticket (generates a presentation token)

As future work, we may extend the tutorial with the following steps:
 
 5) Inspect VIP number (which is stored in the presentation token )
 6) Revoke ticket
 7) Retry presentation, which will fail because the ticket has been revoked
 

Setup the tutorial directory structure by running the following command

  ./setupTutorial.sh
  
This will create a temporary directory tmp with subdirectories for each of the issuer, user, verifier, revocation, and inspection service. The tutorial resources are also copied into this temporary directory. The layout of tmp then looks like this:

tmp/
  issuer/
  user/
  verifier/
  inspector/
  revocation/
  tutorial-resources/
  tutorial.sh

Each of the selfcontained jar files for issuer, user, verifer, inspector, and revocation is now placed in the relevant directory.

Start 6 separate terminal windows.

Run each of the 5 services in a terminal window positioned in the corresponding subdirectory.

  java -jar selfcontained-issuance-service.war 9100

  java -jar selfcontained-user-service.war 9200

  java -jar selfcontained-verification-service.war 9300

  java -jar selfcontained-inspection-service.war 9400

  java -jar selfcontained-revocation-service.war 9500

The arguments refer to the port number. The default port number is 9500.

Please note that on Windows, you have to start the ABC4Trust-UProve.exe manually before going trough the tutorial. On Unix systems (or if you use a Unix-like shell on Windows), the issuer tries to load this .exe automatically from a hardcoded location.

The sixth terminal window is used to run the tutorial commands. Make sure it is positioned in the tmp/ directory. The tutorial commands are collected in the file tutorial.sh. Run them manually one by one to understand the scenario better (recommended). Alternatively, you can run the commands automatically with the following command:

     ./tutorial.sh
  

--- To debug a running service ---

  java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=n -jar target/selfcontained-user-service.war 9200
